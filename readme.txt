Just run the EditorApp and the code will run. The making of nodes, link and the connections are working great. When we create a connection between node it create two line. The deletion of node is also working great. When we delete node all the connections with it get cancelled out and when we delete the link rectangle all the line connected with it get deleted.The print lines are used to detect and show those changes also. 
The mini view is also working good and it does show all the changes on it and does not allow the changes to be done through it.
